# PP-Video-Streamer
This was my first ever real project I had fun doing when I first started coding. I put in a lot of time and had a lot of fun making it.

# Background:
I made it for an old friend that I meet online that liked a different kind of shows that watched them online. He came from a different culture and I wanted to be better friends so I made this for him a years ago. We still talk after 6 years or so.

# Info
There is a lot that went into this project and I had fun making it. A Lot of parsing and a lot of revisions over that time.
